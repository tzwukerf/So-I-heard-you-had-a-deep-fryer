      q: "Every step you took you could hear the muddy squelch, felt the burden on your heart get heavier and heavier. You couldn't feel the rain anymore. You couldn't feel much of anything anymore. <br /> Every twenty years, a Bearer is born to bear The Burden, a curse which the Heavens thought would be funny to cast upon Earth. When Polythesius prayed to the gods to allow him to defeat evil before it happened to never see suffering again, the gods laid down a promise and granted him a gift: For every evil person he kills, the same amount of evil will be negated in the future. <br />He who bears The Burden. He who bears the curse of death. <br />While Polythesius and his village were cheering and drinking in newfound peace, what they didn't realize is that all people have evil. Everyone does, some more than others. Soon, he was outcasted by his village, was feared by all around him, humans and animals alike. When he couldn't see his family again he took his life by the tip of his blessed knife, which allowed the curse to be binded in time. <br />That's not the curse you're suffering from. You got used to the isolation soon, the fear of righteous judgement in passerbyers, the special treatment and the beatings. <br />A solid click as your boots touch stone and you realize you're at the village you were raised on. It looked different than the last time you've been there. The grass was yellow and dead. Half the livestock were laid rotten on the ground, the smell and buzzing of flies will emanating strongly despite the downpour. What livestock were alive were sickly, barely having the energy to stand. The doors of every house was chipped, the wood was molded, the stone degraded. It almost looked as if there were no people living there if you couldn't feel the harsh looks of scorn casted at you from the shadows. It seems people will continue to hate even if you save them. <br />The only thing that looked well built was the road you were stepping on, and although it looked out of place compared to the houses on either side of it that's no surprise to you. The bricks were carefully laid with a variety of rare metals embedded within pattern etchings. On a normal day you would be walking on the dead grass on either side of it, but the downpour was so heavy that nobody would take their horses out to travel. <br />Through the corner of your eye you could see a mother with her son banging on a door, pleading to be let in. When she saw you coming closer, she hugged her son against her tightly, glaring defiantly at you despite her shaking. A few years ago, you might have went to the river to kick stones and swear at the gods. A month ago, you might have felt happy to see that there was love in the world that was worth killing for. Today, you felt nothing. <br />Through the fog you could see your destination. A looming castle made of black bricks at the end of the golden road. The door was open, a bridge already laid down across the expansive moat. You knew they were waiting for you. <br />Your muddy footprints mark every step on the red carpet as you enter. There were no guards, no servants, no mistresses - this was it. For both of you. <br />You've never been in this castle before but you knew where they would be. Up three stairs, in the middle room, there would be a massive wooden door that would take ten men to open with a red carpet leading into it with a big throne front and center. It's almost scary, you think, how exact they copied the outline you two drew in childhood. <br />Upon stepping on the third floor, you can already see the big doors opened. The doors are almost five times your height. There are torches on either side of them which should have emitted a purple color, but they have long since faded out. Apparently, they expected you to get here sooner. <br />You see them sitting on the throne, their stature too small for how collosal the throne is. You've seen them before in their gaudy royal robes, but today all they wore was cotton, similar to the villagers on the streets. You know they prefer the robes, this is to bait sympathy out of you. <br />'Hello, old friend.' A cheeky smile, but you don't return it. 'I thought you would be here sooner. At least a day prior. It was quite a struggle to get used to civilian life, feeding and dressing myself without servants for a day.' <br />They hopped off of the throne and walked to the left wall and pressed down on a loose brick. A slight tremor in the ground, and you could see a secret opening being revealed. <br />'Let's talk somewhere that's not so formal, hmm? After all, I have an honored guest in my home.' <br />'This is your home?' You said. 'Your home is out there in the village, where the people drink dirty water and live on two grains of rice every day because of you. Every room in this castle is as big as a field. Can you honestly call this place your home?' <br />They didn't answer. After a small pause, they smile at you and wave at you to come in the secret room, as if you had said nothing at all. <br />The room they lead you in was smaller, much smaller. There was a fireplace at one wall, with two comfortable chairs next to it and a short table in the middle and a carpet spanning the room. You realize that the design is a recreation of your old house with fancier materials. <br />Your friend gestures to a chair. 'Take a seat.' <br />'No.' <br />'Well, let's talk first, shall we? Maybe we can get some things sorted out.' They push you gently to one chair and you sit on the chair. You expected immediate relief because you haven't rested in a day but your muscles didn't relax. <br />'Well now,' they say, sitting easily opposite of you, 'I know what you're here for. How couldn't I have? The villagers have been talking about it for weeks. But more than that, I know you. I know your dreams, your inspirations, your life before all of this. I know your soul. I also know the burden of the curse on you, how long you've complained about it to me that I could almost imagine having it myself.' They laughed. 'Anyway, I know what you're feeling. I know you lost hope in this world, and you want something new. I can imagine you're tired of killing people you believe are innocents and lost hope in this world. I can change your life, you know. I have so much money, so much power and influence, you can now be anything. I can use my power to stop real evil in this world. You don't have to be a reaper without morals. You don't have to go through bloodshed because it's what's expected of you. You can just be you.' <br />'The villagers trusted you. You promised if they helped you get to the top you would make their lives better.' <br />'Those people hated us! You could see the temptation to murder you every time they looked at you! Shops would deny you service, people would avoid you in fear. Only I was kind enough to befriend you. There's evil in their hearts.' <br />'And none in yours?' <br />'Evil is necessary to contain evil. I am much like yourself. Let me take away your burden for you. Don't you want a normal life?' <br />'Maybe before all of this. Maybe before I knew every innocent person had evil. Before I knew the guilty was right. But that was a long time ago.' <br />'It doesn't have to be. You don't need to keep things bottled up. I know your inner soul hasn't changed, that you want to have a normal life like you dreamed about as a child.' <br />You stood up. 'You miscalculated, my friend. I am too far out for your comfort, for you to understand.' <br />The opened their mouth, but your instinct was quicker, flicking out your blessed blade and stabbing them through the neck. Their neck exploded in blood, the pained gurgle and the look of surprise and betrayal in their eyes were enough to haunt anyone for a lifetime. <br />A last pitiful moan before their body thudded on the floor. The blood was trickling to the fireplace, a slight sizzle as it reaches its destination. The entire room was painted a new color except your coat. <br />'See you in the next life, my friend.' <br />The weight in your heart was gone. All you felt was empty. <br />You thought to yourself that you were going to treat yourself to a cold, strong drink before you remembered that no bar would serve you.",

# penguinz0 Video Description Searcher

A new project I'm trying to test out. Basically, Charlie uploads a lot of videos a week and it's hard to keep track of them all.

Are you interested in what Charlie thinks is the greatest "good chase ending" of All Time? What he thinks is the greatest "wealthy guy" of All Time?

You can search for it right here!

Dev Log:

TODO:
- Autocomplete functionality
- Full PHP support with prevention against SQL injections
- If Charlie edits his videos it is not updated

-Have the database completed

-Needs further research, will be using https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp

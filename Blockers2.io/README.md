# Blockers 2

In junior year of high school, I made a very shitty Javascript game in my coding class. It was originally on CodeHS and was awful and I couldn't even run it anywhere else but CodeHS, so I rewrote it completely with a browser-compatible version of Javascript (instead of CodeHS Javascript). This was during my freshman year of university.

Obviously... it wasn't great. I didn't know what Dijkstra's algorithm was yet, I did no leetcode, I wrote a bunch of code and tested it later to get bugs I lost my mind trying to figure out in endless jumbles of word mess I called "code."

In honor of almost graduating with a computer science degree, I decided I would rewrite the old game I made. I still have the original code from my freshman year that I put on a Github repo and I would do a full comparison and writeup after I'm done, as well as highlight new features, things I've learned during my degree that helped with remaking this code, and so on.

One of my goals is to make it into a Google plugin (like a Snake or 2048 game), but we'll see if I get to it.

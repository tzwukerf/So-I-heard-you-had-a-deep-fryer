NOTE: EVERY FUNCTIONALITY WORKS IN JSFIDDLE AND ON A HOSTED WEBSITE, BUT NOT ON GITHUB
Fun website for anyone with a deep fryer

This was a website created by Susan Wu (me) in spring of 2020, in my freshman year of college. I probably spent over 50 hours on this code but now I know the ins and outs of web design.

I'm still working on this! Once my workload lightens up, I will:



-Make the JSON into its own file instead of cramming it all into one (I was a foolish freshman)

-Remove cursing, make it more accessible for everybody

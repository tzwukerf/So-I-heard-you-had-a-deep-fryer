# Blockers
Game similar to snake, tetris, and other high score games.

To start the game, go to https://tzwukerf.github.io/Blockers.io/

To move, use the arrow keys. You initially play as an O. Every time you move a space, an obstacle appears (represented as a 1). If you go to the top left corner (the square where there's a B) you become an X, which can get rid of 1s if you walk over them, except every time you walk as an X, a 2 appears. Now, you have to get to the P in the bottom left corner to turn back into an O and get rid of the 2s.

Get as many goals as you can before you get locked!

This was a game originally created by Susan Wu (me) as a high school junior in CodeHS (2019) that has since been transported to HTML and JS in fall of 2020 (although it looks ugly now). I'm still working on it!

Once schoolwork lightens up, I'm planning on:

-Fixing the bug where when you run into an obstacle and don't move, it still summons another obstacle

-Making the game look pretty

-Making the size of the board customizable

-Making the P and the B in random locations every time you run over them instead of being in one place

-Making a losing screen (and checking if there is a soft lock / lose condition)

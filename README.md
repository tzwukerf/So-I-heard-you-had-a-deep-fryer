This is my Github pages where I host all the websites I have made.

So I heard you had a deep fryer: Do you have a deep fryer? Find the perfect deep frying recipe, personalized for you! Link: https://tzwukerf.github.io/So-I-heard-you-had-a-deep-fryer.io/

Blockers: A web game I made. You play as the O and every time you move, obstacles start spawning. Collect as many points as possible before you're completely trapped. Change from an O to an X by touching the B to remove the 1s, change from an X to an O by touching the P to remove the 2s. NOTE: This game is unfinished. Link: https://tzwukerf.github.io/Blockers.io/

CURRENT PROJECT: 
penguinz0 video description searcher: The popular Youtuber penguinz0, also known as MoistCr1TiKaL on Twitch, always has his video descriptions as "This is the (blank) of All Time" and I thought it would be fun to create a website that lets you search these up. For example, if you search "waste of money", the link to the video "Worst Juicer Ever Created" will be linked (as you can see in the video, the description is "This is the greatest waste of money of All Time").

Group Projects:

CharityLink: Group Project developed by a team of four Purdue University students, Aanya Jha, Natalie Harrison, Varun Jasti, and Susan Wu. This website was created with the intent to help those in need find resources. Anybody can donate spare items they have around the house to those in need, or they can deliver items from organizations to receivers. The server is not currently up but send me an email if you're interested and I can start it up for you. Made using Javascript, Java, and SQL.

Java Web Server: Final group project for CS180, developed by a team of five, Gonger Wang, Keegan Carter, Hunter Watson, Rahul Goyal, and Susan Wu. Instructions to run the server and login are detailed in the README. Functionality includes creating an account, logging in, add friends, view profile, import profile, and export profile.

Personal Projects:

So I heard you had a deep fryer: Website made for fun. Do you have a deep fryer? Find the perfect deep frying recipe, personalized for you! Link: https://tzwukerf.github.io/So-I-heard-you-had-a-deep-fryer.io/

Blockers: Browser game. You play as the O and every time you move, obstacles start spawning. Collect as many points as possible before you're completely trapped. Change from an O to an X by touching the B to remove the 1s, change from an X to an O by touching the P to remove the 2s. NOTE: This game is unfinished. Link: https://tzwukerf.github.io/Blockers.io/

Trinko Game: Trivia game made for class. Answer five trivia questions and for each question you get right you get a chip to slide down the animated plinko board at the end. Playable with friends with a leaderboard that saves points, whoever gets the most points wins! Link: https://github.com/tzwukerf/Trinko-Game

Current Personal Project: 
Penguinz0 video description searcher: The popular Youtuber penguinz0, also known as MoistCr1TiKaL on Twitch, always has his video descriptions as "This is the (blank) of All Time" and I thought it would be fun to create a website that lets you search these up. For example, if you search "waste of money", the link to the video "Worst Juicer Ever Created" will be linked (as you can see in the video, the description is "This is the greatest waste of money of All Time").
